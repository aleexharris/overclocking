# Overclocking a Ryzen 7950x

Ok so technically not overclocking, more like undervolting and then cranking up the boost clocks up but oh well.

Step 1: Bring down PBO in negative offset steps of 5, down to maximum of 30.

- [ ] -05: 5.2Ghz @ 215w down to 5.1Ghz @ 205w after 20 minutes.
- [ ] -10: 
- [ ] -15: 
- [ ] -20: 
- [ ] -25: 
- [ ] -30: 

Rethinking my testing a bit... The case I need to cater for is the low-usage case, not the max power one... Written a new script for testing per-core boost as well.
